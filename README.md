# Mongoose News Scrapper 
In this assignment, the goal was to allow any user to scrape news from any site. I used BBC sport section to scrape news about current sport trends. The user can then see the Headline, a breif summary, then an option to either save the article or click on it to go directly to the article. The user could comment on a saved article and see thier saved content.
